# Checkpoint 8

Starting from checkpoint 7. 

We first flip the UV coordinates per character. 

Next, we scale the vertex positions such that the proportions are correct.

Finally we move the two rectangles right next to each other using the character data given by stb_truetype.h, as if we were writing the string "yG"
