# Checkpoint 6

Starting from checkpoint 5. 

We now begin the real work! Instead of generating a toy texture, we can generate a real bitmap texture directly from a font file and paste a part of that onto our rectangles to draw a different characters. We will be using stb_truetype.h to simplify this process. We will safe the bitmap to file to have a look at it, but we won't be ready  to use it just yet.
